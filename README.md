# 🧑‍💻 DSA Practice in C++

This repository contains my solutions to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems in **C++**.  
I am following **Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet** and practicing on **LeetCode & GeeksforGeeks**.  

## 📂 Structure
The problems are organized by topic:
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked List
- Stack & Queue
- Trees & BST
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Greedy Algorithms

## 📊 Progress
- ✅ 40/450 Striver’s DSA Sheet  
- ✅ 25 LeetCode Problems Solved  
- ✅ 10 GFG Problems Solved  

*(updated weekly)*

## 🚀 Goal
- Solve **300+ problems** before placements.  
- Master patterns like Binary Search, Sliding Window, DP, Graph Traversals.  

## ⚡ How to Use
Each file contains:
- Problem statement (with platform link)  
- Approach explained in comments  
- Clean and optimized C++ code  

Example:  
```cpp
// Problem: Two Sum
// Platform: LeetCode #1
// Approach: HashMap to store complements
// Time: O(n), Space: O(n)
